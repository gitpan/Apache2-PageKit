Please remember to BACK UP YOUR FILES before attempting to run migration
scripts.
=============================================================
Migration from 1.11 to 1.12

1. It is important to note that if PageKit runs in a perl 5.6.x environment
	all internal pages are in default_output_charset. For perl 5.8.x
	all these pages are in perl's own unicode format. This change should
	be transparent to the user but many libraries do not support perl's
	new character handling.

=============================================================
Migration from 1.10 to 1.11

=============================================================
Migration from 1.09 to 1.10

=============================================================
Migration from 1.08 to 1.09

1. Static pages can be protected with the reqire_login attribute in the
	Config.xml page and section tags. This is enabled by default.
        If you want backward compatible or you do not want to protect
        static pages, set the global option protect_static="no".

=============================================================
Migration from 1.07 to 1.08

1. Remember that you need libxml2 >= 2.4.10, libxslt >= 1.0.9,
	XML::LibXML >= 1.31 and XML::LibXSLT >= 1.31

2. Apache::SessionX replaces Apache::PageKit::Session.
	For now you can also choose your Session-Toolkit with
        the global config options:

        session_class = 'Apache::PageKit::Session' and
        page_session_class = 'Apache::PageKit::Session'

	this settings choose the old Session class, but the old class
	might go away in the future.

3. inside the hook pkit_cleanup_code it is impossible to use $model->session
	and $model->page_session. They are already deleted. If you have to use
        one of the session objects that late, use pkit_post_common_code. 

=============================================================
Migration from 1.06 to 1.07

1. The returncode from your pagecode is now ignored. If you have to set such
	a code, see $model->pkit_status_code;.

=============================================================
Migration from 1.05 to 1.06

1. __PACKAGE__ is not interpolated run
2. The PKIT_COMPONENT tag did NOT support a single unnamed parameter anymore.

	<PKIT_COMPONENT filexx>

        changed to

        <PKIT_COMPONENT NAME="filexx"/>

3. Digest::MD5->md5_hex changed to Digest::MD5::md5_hex in Common.pm
4. MD5->hexhash changed to Digest::MD5::md5_hex in MyModel.pm
5. Remove some possible "use undefined" warnings
6. Write "use Digest::MD5 ();" before "use DBI;"

run
migration/migrate_pagekit_1.05_to_1.06.pl /path/to/pagekit_root

=============================================================
Migration from 1.04 to 1.05

1. pkit_done parameter is no longer automatically filled in HTML
	Forms.  So if you have HTML code that looks like this:

	<input type="hidden" name="pkit_done">

	Change to

	<input type="hidden" name="pkit_done"
		value="<MODEL_VAR NAME="pkit_done">">

=============================================================
Migration from 1.02 to 1.03

1. XSL files are now located in View/pkit_view directory instead of
	View/pkit_view/XSL.  Simply move all files out of the XSL
	directories into their parent directiories.  If you don't have
	any XSL files, skip this step.

=============================================================
Migration from 0.99 to 1.00

1. Several of the <PKIT_*> tags have changed.  To update the templates
run
migration/migrate_pagekit_0.99_to_1.00.pl /path/to/pagekit_root

=============================================================
Migration from 0.98 to 0.99

1. The View/Component and View/Page directories have merged into one
directory under View.  To merge the templates, run
migration/migrate_pagekit_0.98_to_0.99.pl

2. <PKIT_VAR NAME="SELFURL"> has been changed to <PKIT_SELFURL>
You can apply this change easily by running from the View directory:

cd /path/to/pagekitroot/View
perl -pi -e 's!<PKIT_VAR +NAME *= *"?SELFURL"? *>!<PKIT_SELFURL>!gi' \
	`find . -name "*.tmpl"`

3. $model->input_param has been changed to $model->input for getting
	request parameters and $model->fillinform for filling in HTML forms
	and $model->pnotes for passing around data between different handlers

	$model->output_param has been changed to $model->output

4. $model->input_param('pkit_user') and $model->output_param('pkit_user')
	is no longer set by authentication code.  Instead, set
	$model->pnotes(pkit_user => $pkit_user) in your
	pkit_auth_session_key in your model code and use
	$model->pnotes('pkit_user') to access the set value

=============================================================
Migration from 0.97 to 0.98

1. Apache::PageKit::Error has been renamed to Apache::ErrorReport
If you use PerlSetVar PKIT_ERROR_HANDLER anywhere in your httpd.conf
file, you should change it to PerlSetVar ErrorReportHandler

You can do this easily by running:

perl -pi -e 's/PerlSetVar PKIT_ERROR_HANDLER/PerlSetVar ErrorReportHandler/g' httpd.conf

Also if you include Apache::PageKit::Error in your httpd.conf run:

perl -pi -e 's/PerlModule Apache::PageKit::Error/PerlModule Apache::ErrorReport/g' httpd.conf

=============================================================
Migration from 0.96 to 0.97

1. The DTD for the Config file is now PageKit_Config-0.97.dtd.  You
should update Config/Config.xml to reflect this and copy
PageKit_Config-0.97.dtd into the Config directory.

2. Support for navigation bars has been removed.  If you had been using
them, please contact me and I will help you work around this.  If there
is sufficient demand, I will try to implement navigation bars again in a more
clean and robust manner (XPointers in Content XML files, with hooks in
Model code??).  Note that these template variable will no longer work:
<PKIT_LOOP NAME="BREAD_CRUMB"> and <PKIT_VAR NAME="LAST_CRUMB">.  However,
it is recommended that you keep the parent_id in your Config.xml file, as
this might be used in the future.

3. $model->content_param no longer works, since content is now compiled into
the template and it is not possible to get or set the tags run time.
Instead you can simply place <MODEL_VAR> tags into the content and set
them from the model.

4. <PKIT_VAR NAME="LOGINOUT_LINK"> has been removed since
it isn't really elegant and can easily be replaced.  To replace, use
something like:

<MODEL_IF NAME="PKIT_USER">
	<a href="/login_page?pkit_done=http://yoursite/page_to_view_after_login">Log In</a>
<MODEL_ELSE>
	<a href="<PKIT_VAR NAME="SELFURL">pkit_logout=1">Log Out</a>
</MODEL_IF>

5. The content part of pagekit has been rewritten from the
ground up.  You should use the included migrate_pagekit_0.96_to_0.97.pl
file to update your content file.

*********NOTE that this doesn't seem to work with CDATA sections - I'm not
sure why - if you figure why, let me know.  Otherwise, just do what I did,
convert this CDATA sections to PCDATA, escaping any <, >, and & characters
along the way.

6. The html_clean_level option has been moved
from the Global section to the Server section of the
configuration file.  If you have specifed the 'html_clean_level'
option in your Config.xml file, you
have to move the attribute(s) from the <GLOBAL> tag to
<SERVER> tag.

7. Login code has been rewriten.  To login, you must set the 'pkit_login'
to a true value.  In addition, the 'new_credential' option is no longer
supported.  Instead, you should make sure that 'require_login' is set to
'no' and perform a pkit_redirect in the model code to a URL that logs
the user in.  See newacct2 in eg/Model/MyPageKit/MyModel.pm for an
example of how this should work.  In addition, you must rewrite
pkit_auth_credential to take the credentials from the input_param method.

8. <PKIT_COMPONENT> can no longer be set dynamically.  If you were using
this feature, please contact me and I'll see what I can do.  If there is
sufficient demand, I will put support for this back in.

=============================================================
Migration from 0.94 to 0.95

1. A couple of new configuration options have been added to
Config/Config.xml.

You should replace the Config/Config.dtd file in your Pagekit directory
with the Config.dtd contained in the eg/ directory of your distribution
to reflect this change.

==============================================================
Migration from 0.93 to 0.94

1. MyPageKit has been replaced with MyPageKit::Model.

To update rename MyPageKit to MyPageKit::Model and rename
auth_credential and auth_session_key to pkit_auth_credential and
pkit_session_credential.  Modify methods to take $model as
first argument instead of $pk.

Also, replace handler with pkit_dbi_connect, pkit_session_setup,
and pkit_common_code.  See the code in eg/Model/MyPageKit/Common.pm
for an example of how to do this.
